Module 1 Challenge - Excel challenge
The purpose of this assignment was to organise and analyse a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.
This was done through the use of pivot tables to organise data and graphs to help visualise the data.
From this we could analyse the data for any potential trends which I have done in the report.
